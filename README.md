## Sentora Vagrant Development Envs

```
$ vagrant up
```

I'll be working on a way to make these envs a little easier for us to configure.
I want a way to lauch 2 boxes (32 / 64 bit) & OS depending on user specified params.

Also load folders for sentora /modules , themes etc

Working project - feel free to contact me with any suggestion
